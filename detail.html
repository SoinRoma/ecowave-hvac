                            <h1>HVAC</h1>
                            <p>The main purposes of a Heating, Ventilation and
                                Air-Conditioning(HVAC) system are to help
                                maintain good indoor air quality through
                                adequate ventilation with filtration and provide
                                thermal comfort. HVAC systems are among the
                                largest energy consumers in schools. The choice
                                and design of the HVAC system can also affect
                                many other high performance goals, including
                                water consumption (water cooled air
                                conditioning equipment) and acoustics.
                                The following actions detail how engineers can
                                design a quality system that is cost-competitive
                                with traditional ventilation designs, while
                                successfully providing an appropriate quantity
                                and quality of outdoor air, lower energy costs
                                and easier maintenance.

                            <h1>IAQ</h1>
                            <p>You might expect some
                                relief from allergens and
                                the allergies that they
                                cause during the winter
                                months. However, the
                                colder months have
                                proven to be very a very challenging time for
                                those that suffer from indoor air allergies. Indoor
                                air allergies are caused by dust and the allergens
                                that are contained/associated with it. Weather
                                you can see them or not, pollutants, allergens, and
                                other debris are lingering in your air. Improving
                                your home's indoor air quality (IAQ) during the
                                winter months can make a big difference,
                                especially to those with allergies and respiratory
                                issues. The EPA reports that the air that we
                                breathe in our homes, in schools and in offices
                                can put us at risk for health problems. Improving
                                your lAQ will reduce allergens such as dust,
                                pollen, mold spores, pet dander, and other
                                impurities and help your family breathe a bit a
                                easier.</p>

                            <p>Circulation - The most beneficial thing you can
                                do during the winter months (when your home is
                                typically closed up) is keep the air circulating,
                                which is a form of air replacement. On a "warmer"
                                winter day, let some clean fresh air in to circulate
                                throughout your home. This refreshes your indoor
                                air and allows the allergens that are "trapped"
                                inside your house a chance to move outside,

                            <p>Humidity - As the air becomes more and more
                                dry, increased humidity is often desired in the cold,
                                dry months. However, many allergens, such as
                                dust mites, mold, and bacteria thrive in overly-
                                humid conditions. Turning on your humidifier is
                                definitely necessary, but make sure to keep the
                                relative indoor humidity level around 35%-50%.
                                Also important - replacing your humidifier filters
                                with fresh humidifier pads or filters about twice
                                per season. When using the bathroom, especially
                                when enjoying hot sowers, use the bathroom
                                exhaust fans to keep the moisture level down.
                                Keep an eye on basements and storage areas as
                                well, as these are ideal locations for potential
                                moisture.</p>

                            <p>Air Filtration - Your furnace filters are a huge help
                                with improving lAQ as their function goes beyond
                                the basic

                                system (their main job). In fact, they add a level of
                                defense by cleansing your air of impurities.
                                Always keep on a regular schedule with changing
                                your air filters as well. This allows your system to
                                function optimally and continuously provides new
                                surface areas for dust and allergens to collect on.</p>

                                only help keep the level of contaminants and dust
                                to a minimum. Once dust and debris has settled, it
                                is more difficult for them to be picked up by your
                                furnace filter unless the area is disturbed. Regular
                                vacuuming, dusting, and cleaning of surfaces will
                                re-disperse the dust, allowing another opportunity
                                for it to be captured by your filter before settling
